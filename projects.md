Many experiments are too expensive or impossible to conduct. Many simulations are too expensive or impossible to conduct with decent accuracy. Artificial intelligence methods are another way to go, but if everything is costly, how to generate sufficient amount of training data? One of the solutions are machine learning frameworks capable of exploiting data of varied fidelity (accuracy). However, if low-quality data is abundant and high-accuracy information is scarce, it is still possible to accurately predict the unknown. The picture on the right shows a pedagogical example of how multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms can take advantage of highly inaccurate, seemingly useless data.<br/>
<img  align="left" src="\assets\images\domain_2.PNG" height="205" width="205"/> In my thesis I developed a machine learning algorithm based on Gaussian processes and Bayesian inference capable of  (1) using data of mixed accuracy in a smart way, (2) delivering very satisfactory predictions of a complex flow characteristics. Multi-dimensional training and test data supplied to the model was generated by a parallel C++ CFD solver. Such solver requires hours to complete single accurate run on a powerful machine. Developed ML model, once trained, takes seconds to provide the solution. Similar approaches have recently been intensively investigated and gained a lot of traction in academia - check, for example, work by <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/109316">Perdikaris et al.</a> if you want to know more.

While working at Bentley Motors, my main project was to develop a virtual vehicle that could help eliminate use of testing mules in the early development stages. I was responsible for parametric modelling of a whole vehicle, driver and road. To accomplish given task, I used commercial softwares such as IPG CarMaker and AVL products. Moreover, in order to assess the quality of virtual tests, I worked with actual benchmark measurements using e.g. FlexRay signals and National Instruments processing tools.

### 3. Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations

<i class="fas fa-building"></i>  [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) &ensp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> > 300h   &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Grade: 1.0 - 1.3

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<img  align="right" src="\assets\images\cfd_1.PNG" height="500" width="500"/>
During MSc studies I completed two lab courses focused on fluid dynamics simulations: CFD Lab and Turbulent Flow on HPC systems. In both, I had a chance to transform physical and mathematical routines into fully functional and efficient flow solvers. Output from one of the projects, i.e. flow over backward facing step, is presented on the right hand side. During the course, I have implemented multiple methods ranging from Navier-Stokes equations to techniques stemming from statistical physics, such as Lattize-Boltzamnn method with heat transfer. All work was done either by myself or in small groups. <img  align="left" src="\assets\images\scaling.PNG" height="500" width="500"/>  <br/> Accurate CFD calculations require huge amount of computing power and memory, therefore, it was crucial to develop numerically stable algorithms but also to make sure that the implementation scales well. To achieve that, most of the projects required parallelization in order to obtain solutions in reasonable time. Graph on the left is an excerpt from one of the projects showing how developed application performed on many core systems <br/>

### 4. Virtual Sensors and Optimal Allocation Problem: Projects at Siemens

<i class="fas fa-building"></i> Siemens AG &ensp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> > 500h    &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Patent (pending) <br/>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Although optimal allocation project is going to be published as a scientific paper, currently both projects that I completed at Siemens are confidential. Description presented below is, therefore, general and aims to focus on technologies rather than applications.
<br/><br/>
1.<b> Virtual Sensors</b>: in this project I used machine learning and deep learning techniques to build a so called virtual sensor. Virtual sensor can be a piece of software that aims to mimic outputs of a physical sensor based purely on inflow of real-time data (there are no actual physical measurements of the QoI). Simplified example could be a system where temperature is measured in 3 different locations. It often turns out that based on measurements from just 2 sensors, it is possible to predict the outputs of the third one with high confidence. Such approach might lead to decreased capital and operational expenditures in large projects. My work involved development of multi-dimensional virtual sensors for vehicle exhaust system and steam turbines.
<br/><br/>
2. <b>Optimal Allocation Problem</b>: to find optimal allocation for a complex multi-dimensional system, it is typically hard or impossible to explore whole space of feasible solutions. Complexity of such problems is exploding and sophisticated methods must be employed in order to reach optimal results in a reasonable time. Characteristic of the project that I was working on allowed to define whole problem in an integer domain and therefore optimization using integer programming could be used. In other words, the algorithm was expected to provide Yes/No answers for all "locations" along all dimensions. I developed a whole Python implementation and was responsible for definition of optimization variables, constraints and objective functions etc. Due to novel application and highly satisfactory results, the whole approach has been submitted as an invention with my contribution amounting to 1/3.<br/>

### 5. Handwritten Digits Recognition: Machine Learning Classic

Before starting my machine learning-oriented master's thesis, I took probably the most popular ML course in the world, i.e. the class by Andrew Ng. It provided fundamental knowledge about ML techniques and access to short but gripping projects such as digit recognition or spam detection. <br/>
