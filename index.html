<div style="text-align: justify"> Hi! <br/><br/>
I created this small personal website to share some of the projects that I have recently completed. I also treat it as a place where I can add some extra information about my academic and professional career choices.
<br/><br/>
My name is Rafal and I come from Poland, but since almost 4 years I have lived abroad. After finishing my bachelor's studies in a vibrant city of Wroclaw, I moved to United Kingdom, where for 1 year I worked at Bentley Motors with focus on driving simulation. Driven by enthusiasm for cars and virtual development, I decided to pursue my further career goals in Munich - city that not only is the Europe's biggest automotive hub but also is home to a great university. At Technical University of Munich (TUM), I successfully completed Computational Science and Engineering master's degree. Moreover, in the course of studies I became interested in data science and data-driven approches, which encoured me to write thesis in this field. Finally, shortly before the end of the last semester I joined Siemens as an intern and stayed there until the end of March 2020.  For more details please check the Résumé and Projects pages.
<br/><br/>
After hours I very much enjoy bouldering, badminton and cooking. If there is more time I try to travel and explore as much as possible. In the headers you can see pictures from some of the recent trips.
<br/><br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
Rafal
