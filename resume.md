### Software Development/Machine Learning - Internship

<i class="fas fa-building"></i>  [Siemens AG](https://new.siemens.com/global/en.html) &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  München, DE &emsp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 7 mos, part-time   &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Patent (pending)
<br/><br/>
At Siemens I joined Corporate Technology Department, which is responsible for creation and feasibility studies of bleeding-edge solutions, that are not available in the industry yet.  In both of my projects I was responsible for development of novel algorthims: one from machine learning area and one based on integer programming. Slightly more detailed description of both tasks can be found on Projects page. Both projects were completed in Python, with attention to object oriented design, performance, visualization, and documention.

### (Virtual) Powertrain Developement - Internship

<i class="fas fa-building"></i>  [Bentley Motors](https://www.bentleymotors.com/en.html) &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  Crewe, UK &emsp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 12 mos, full-time   &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Score: *Exceeds requirements*  <br/><br/>
I completed my placement at Bentley Motors in the Powertrain Department where I was responsible for deployment of virtual test driving simulation. During the project I went through all of the stages from choice and purchase of the software up to modelling and validation of the virtual vehicle. Knowledge of car design, programming and modelling was crucial to deliver all of the objecives. It was also essential to efficiently deal with internal customers, international counterparts and suppliers, as required data could not be sourced only locally. Apart from the main simulation project, I was involed in series of other tasks such:
automated test data processing or building a virtual prototyping strategy consitent with main development process.

### Software Development - Research Assistant

<i class="fas fa-building"></i>  [Technical Univ. of Munich](https://www.tum.de) &ensp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  München, DE &ensp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 3 mos, part-time   &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-code"> </i> Open source

In the middle of the studies I decied to join a group of researchers at TUM's Chair of Scientific Computing. For 3 months I helped in development of an open source, parallel coupling tool [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/). My task was to advance development of a structural solver written in Python with help of FEniCS library.<br/><br/>

### Computational Science and Engineering, MSc

<i class="fas fa-university"></i>  [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"> </i>  2.0 (above-average) &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> DAAD scholarship

Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) programme focuses on solving very complex problems from scientific and engineering domains using sophisticated optimization methods as well as artifical intelligence aproaches. CSE core courses such as Advanced Progamming or Numerical Programming are supplemented by elective modules from various areas. My choice of electives comprised, for example: Visual Data Analytics, Fundamental Algorthims or CFD Lab. In my master's thesis (described on the Projects page), I developed machine learning algortihm capable of accurate predictions a complex multi-phase flow. All in all, I finished full MSc programme in 2 years with an above-average final grade.

### Control Engineering and Robotics, BEng

<i class="fas fa-university"></i>  [Wroclaw Univ. of Sci. & Tech.](https://www.pwr.edu.pl/en/) &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"> </i> very good &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Rector's scholarship (top 10%)

Control Engineering and Robotics was for me a broad and comprhensive degree, that combined worlds of informatics and mechanical engineering. On the one hand, I was trained to code (e.g. in C/C++), on the other hand I also learned about the the design of machines or production methods. Such a mixture is to my mind beneficial, especially while working in the inustry, as it ensures much better understanding of processes.
