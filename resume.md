### Software Development/Machine Learning - Internship

<i class="fas fa-building"></i> Siemens AG &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  München, DE &emsp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 7 mos, part-time   &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Patent (pending) <br/>

At Siemens I joined Corporate Technology - department responsible for creation and feasibility studies of bleeding-edge solutions, that are not available in the industry yet.  In both of my projects, I was responsible for development of novel algorithms: one from machine learning field and one based on integer programming. Slightly more detailed description of both tasks can be found on Projects page. All my tasks were completed in Python, with attention to object-oriented design, performance, visualization and documentation.

### (Virtual) Powertrain Development - Internship

<i class="fas fa-building"></i> Bentley Motors &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  Crewe, UK &emsp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 12 mos, full-time   &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Score: *Exceeds requirements*  <br/>

I completed my placement at Bentley Motors in the Powertrain Department, where I was responsible for deployment of virtual test driving simulation. During the project I went through all stages from choice and purchase of the software up to modelling and validation of the virtual vehicle. Knowledge of car design, programming and modelling was crucial to deliver all of the objectives. It was also essential to efficiently deal with internal customers, international counterparts and suppliers, as required data could not always be sourced locally. Apart from the main simulation project, I was involved in a series of other tasks such as:
automated test data processing or building a virtual prototyping strategy consistent with the main development process. All in all, my performance was assessed with "Exceeds requirements" note and special recognition for quality of work.

### Software Development - Research Assistant

<i class="fas fa-building"></i>  [Technical Univ. of Munich](https://www.tum.de) &ensp;   <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"> </i>  München, DE &ensp; <i class="fas fa-hourglass-half"> </i> 3 mos, part-time   &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-code"> </i> Open source

In the middle of the MSc studies I decided to join a group of researchers at TUM's Chair of Scientific Computing. For 3 months I was supporting development of an open source, parallel coupling tool [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/). My task was to advance implementation of a structural solver written in Python with help of [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) platform.<br/><br/>

### Computational Science and Engineering, MSc

<i class="fas fa-university"></i>  [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) &emsp;   <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"> </i>  2.0 (above-average) &emsp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> DAAD scholarship

Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) programme focuses on solving very complex problems from scientific and engineering domains, using sophisticated optimization methods as well as artificial intelligence. CSE core courses such as Advanced Programming or Numerical Programming are supplemented by elective modules from various areas. My choice of electives comprised, for example: Visual Data Analytics, Fundamental Algorithms or CFD Lab. In my master's thesis (described on the Projects page), I developed a machine learning algorithm capable of mimicking outputs of a complex multi-phase flow solver. Overall, I finished full MSc programme in 2 years with merit.

### Control Engineering and Robotics, BEng

<i class="fas fa-university"></i>  [Wroclaw Univ. of Sci. & Tech.](https://www.pwr.edu.pl/en/) &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"> </i> very good &ensp;  <i class="fas fa-award"> </i> Rector's scholarship (top 10%)

Control Engineering and Robotics was for me a broad and comprehensive degree - a springboard that allowed further self-development in many different directions. On the one hand, I was trained in control theory and programming (e.g. in C/C++). On the other hand, I learnt about principles of mechanical engineering and design. To my mind, such mixture is especially beneficial while working in the industry, as it enables holistic understanding of processes and greatly improves communication between different functions.
